Hi everyone,

here comes the second beta version of XCSoar 6.4. This version includes the
bugfixes introduced by XCSoar 6.3.11 from earlier today and also some other
fixes and improvements.

I've been flying at the german junior nationals with the first 6.4 beta version
for over 24 hours now and I didn't experience any major problems. Live tracking
via [SkyLines](https://skylines.aero/) worked quite nice! This means that
the release of XCSoar 6.4 is close and you can probably expect it some time next
week.

The next maintenance release will be 6.3.12, to be released on demand.  
The next major release will be 6.4, going stable very soon!
