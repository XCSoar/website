Hi,

here's another preview version of XCSoar 6.2.  There are dozens of
major changes and optimisations since the first alpha.  Perhaps the
most important new feature is the new Android IOIO device driver some
of you have been waiting for.

The CPU usage of the Android version has been reduced: on my Streak,
it runs at 9% CPU usage (previously it was 40%).  Look forward to
longer battery runtime!

Altair+Vega users have better responsiveness of the vario gauge.  We
hope that all regressions since 5.2.4 have been fixed by now.  The
Vega configuration dialog is still broken, though, but one of our
developers is working on that.
