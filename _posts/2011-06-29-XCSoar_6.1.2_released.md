title: XCSoar 6.1.2 released!
---
Hi everyone,

the second maintenance release of XCSoar 6.1 fixes a few minor (but
annoying) bugs.  The NMEA parser is more reliable, memory usage was
reduced, UTC offsets were fixed, coast lines are displayed correctly
now, and more.

If you see land now where water should be you will need a new map file.
You can either use our [pregenerated maps](/download/data.html) or the
[Map Generator](http://mapgen.xcsoar.org) for that.

The next maintenance release will be 6.1.3, to be released on demand.
The next major release will be 6.2, going beta next month.
