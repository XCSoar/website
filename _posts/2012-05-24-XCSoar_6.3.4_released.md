Hi everyone!

Here comes the XCSoar 6.3.4 maintenance release. This version fixes a few minor but sometimes annoying bugs. Owners of the CAI302 will be glad to hear the the 30 second timeout problem is fixed again and owners of certain Samsung devices that don't use an external SD card can now use the internal storage again.

We would like to thank you for the positive feedback on our vario filtering code. Since this seems to be working so great now, we have started working on audio vario output for XCSoar 6.4. Stay tuned!
