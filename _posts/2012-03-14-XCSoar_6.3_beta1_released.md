Hi everyone!

Today we start the beta-testing phase of XCSoar 6.3. This means that the
feature list for XCSoar 6.3 is now complete and we will focus on fixing
the remaining bugs. You can expect the final version very soon. If you find
any remaining bugs please write a [bug report](/develop/new_ticket.html) or
[contact us](/contact/).

Compared to the alpha3 version we have fixed another few things and added
some features for the CAI302 device driver. You can read about the details
