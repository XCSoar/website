Hi everyone,

since there were still a number of unfixed bugs in the stable branch of XCSoar,
we've decided to publish yet another maintenance release before the launch of
the new XCSoar 6.4.

There were some issues when keyhole sectors were used in racing tasks resulting
in XCSoar not switching to the next waypoint automatically. A few other bugs
were also fixed that could potentially freeze or crash the application or were
responsible for rendering problems.

Changelog:

  <{{ site.download_server_url }}6.3.11/NEWS.txt>

  <{{ site.download_server_url }}6.3.11/>

The next maintenance release will be 6.3.12, to be released on demand.  
The next major release will be 6.4, going stable very soon!
