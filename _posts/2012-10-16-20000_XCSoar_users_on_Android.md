Hi everyone,

in January we announced that almost 10.000 pilots were using XCSoar on Android,
in June that number was already up to over 15.000 pilots. We are now proud to
announce that we just hit the mark of 20.000 pilots using XCSoar on their
Android devices.

These are only the pilots using the Android version though. There is also still
a significant number of pilots using XCSoar on other platforms like the Triadis
Altair and Windows Mobile in general.

We hope to continue this upward trend in the next year with new features coming
soon. We are currently finishing the next maintenance release (XCSoar 6.4.2)
and after that we will publish the first early preview version of the upcoming
XCSoar 6.5.

We are also working hard on the [SkyLines](https://skylines.aero/) platform
and we hope to bring you the terrain elevation data for your flights very soon.
In addition to all that, I am working on a tracking client for the iPhone users
out there. It has the simple purpose of sending your position in regular
intervals to the SkyLines server, so that other people can follow your flights
live on the map.
