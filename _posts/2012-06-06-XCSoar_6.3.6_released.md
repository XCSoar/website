Hi everyone!

Today we give you the sixth maintenance release for XCSoar 6.3. This release
is all about the stability under the hood. There are almost no directly visible
changes, but a lot has happend below the surface. IOIO users can once again
take advantage of a few bugfixes that make the connection to the board more
stable. 

In the last release we have added automatic crash detection and logging for
Android. We got a few negative comments on Google Play about the new requested
user permission "Read personal logfiles" and we would like to assure you once
again that XCSoar is only using this permission to access the crash logs. You
can find the related code
[here](https://github.com/XCSoar/XCSoar/blob/v6.3.6/src/Android/LogCat.cpp)
This is an important feature for us that already led to a few detailed
bugreports and two bugfixes, that wouldn't have been possible without it.
