The development of 6.6 has been delayed a bit.  Some of the new
features needed some more consideration and polish.  This is the
second alpha with many bug fixes and a few new features.  The beta
test will begin next week.

This is the first release to support the
[Cubieboard](http://cubieboard.org/).
