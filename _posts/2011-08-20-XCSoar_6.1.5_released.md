Hi everyone,

this evening we have released the fifth maintenance version of XCSoar 6.1. We 
had noticed some minor bugs and felt that another stable release would be 
necessary before releasing XCSoar 6.2 next month.

This release fixes some problems with TNP airspace file parsing, temperature 
readings from certain devices, airspace distance calculations and a few polars 
(LS4 as the most prominent example). Read the complete list of changes in the 
change log that is linked below.

The next major release will be 6.2, going beta soon.  
The 6.1 series will be discontinued after the final release 6.2.
