Hi everyone!

Just one week and we have yet another maintenance release for you. This release
fixes a regression that got introduced in XCSoar 6.3.1. It should now be
possible again to download IGC files from the Flarm and hopefully it will be
even a bit more stable than before.

In addition to that we added a filter mechanism for Android devices that have
a barometric sensor (for example the Samsung Galaxy Note). Until now the vario
was quite jumpy even when the phone was not moving and the new filter should
calm things down a bit. Please report back how well this is working out!

The next maintenance release will be 6.3.3, to be released on demand.  
The next major release will be 6.4, scheduled in about three to four month.
