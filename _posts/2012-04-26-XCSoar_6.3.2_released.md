Hi everyone!

Just one week and we have yet another maintenance release for you. This release
fixes a regression that got introduced in XCSoar 6.3.1. It should now be
possible again to download IGC files from the Flarm and hopefully it will be
even a bit more stable than before.

In addition to that we added a filter mechanism for Android devices that have
a barometric sensor (for example the Samsung Galaxy Note). Until now the vario
was quite jumpy even when the phone was not moving and the new filter should
calm things down a bit. Please report back how well this is working out!

Changelog:

The next maintenance release will be 6.3.3, to be released on demand.
The next major release will be 6.4, scheduled in about three to four month.
