The upcoming XCSoar version 6.7 is feature complete, and this is the
first beta version.  From now on, we'll concentrate on fixing the
remaining bugs.

Some of the changes since 6.7_alpha2:

* the Kobo shows a flight log while powered off
* flight logger no longer records simulated/replayed flights
* improved user interface layout on some dialogs, auto resize upon
  display rotation
* improved north arrow look
* fix the TCP client which didn't work in most cases
* fix AAT task bug (AAT disabled during simulator/replay switch)
* fix option "start requires arm"

The final 6.7 release will be ready before end of September.
