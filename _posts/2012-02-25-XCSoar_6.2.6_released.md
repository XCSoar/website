Hi everyone,

once again another maintenance release for XCSoar 6.2. This will probably be
the last release of the XCSoar 6.2 product line. We will soon begin with the
beta testing phase of XCSoar 6.3.

In this release we have fixed a number of mostly smaller bugs. Problems with
manual wind settings and the final glide AutoMC feature should be repaired now.
Also the Vega vario configuration dialog is now finally working properly again.

You can read about all other bugfixes in our changelog:

The next maintenance release will be 6.2.7, to be released on demand.
The next major release will be 6.3, to be released around February.
