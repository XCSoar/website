Hi everyone!

Well, good thing that we do these beta-testing phases. You have found quite a
few bugs in the short time that beta1 was released and we would like to thank
you for that. We have fixed those bugs and are now releasing the second beta
version of XCSoar 6.3. If you find more bugs don't hesitate to tell us!
