Hi everyone!

We are getting closer and closer to the final release of XCSoar 6.3 and this
will probably be the last beta version before we go final!

This version includes an important bugfix that caused freezes when using
Bluetooth on Android. Some other things are also fixed like for example
the Flarm team colors for all non-English speaking users. Don't ask why...
I would also like to highlight that Helmut Rohs has started to update the manual
again and the current version includes a few new and changed chapters about
new features.

Changelog:
