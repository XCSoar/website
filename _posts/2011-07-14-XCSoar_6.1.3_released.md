title: XCSoar 6.1.3 released!
---
Hi everyone,

the third maintenance release of XCSoar 6.1 has a lot of Android
specific rendering fixes.  Terrain display on the Samsung Galaxy S II
and other modern chips works now.  Triadis has sponsored a Galaxy S II
for debugging - big thanks for the support!

Memory usage was reduced again, which should make PPC2000 and other
Windows CE devices more smooth.  The rest is mostly minor user
interface and task engine fixes.

The next major release will be 6.2, going alpha next week.
