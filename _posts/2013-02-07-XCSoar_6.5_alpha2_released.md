Hi everyone!

Another week, another release. We have just uploaded the second alpha-testing
version of XCSoar 6.5 to the server. This release fixed a few bugs that you had
found in the last alpha version and improved a few other things. Here is a short
list of changes compared to alpha1:

* new "Bluetooth disabled" warning on Android
* improved Flarm/Traffic list
* added "White" terrain color setting (to only show coastlines)
* support for pressure and voltage sensors on IOIO board
* fixed crash in devices dialog
* fixed terrain rendering issues
