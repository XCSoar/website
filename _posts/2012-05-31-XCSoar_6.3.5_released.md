Hi everyone!

This is an important maintenance release for all Android users. From now on
XCSoar will automatically save some debug information when it crashes. Aside
from that, a few bugs were fixed:

 * Horizontal stripes in the terrain
 * Rounding errors in finish line optimization
 * Possible crashes during flight download
 * Hanging IOIO/Bluetooth connection

We would love to get some feedback on the last item. We got many reports on
IOIO connections dropping out from time to time and we hope that this patch
improves the situation.

Changelog:

The next maintenance release will be 6.3.6, to be released on demand.
The next major release will be 6.4, scheduled in about two months.
