Hi everyone!

One month after the last release we've fixed a few more minor bugs and are ready
to release the next (and hopefully last) maintenance release for XCSoar 6.4.

Triadis customers might be happy to hear that the MacCready setting of the Vega
vario is handled properly now and the XCSoar checklist dialog is now scrollable
on the Altair again.

Apart from that we have added a polar for the LAK-12 glider and have fixed a bug
in the task engine that could produce rounding errors for certain tasks.

One user located in Helsinki made us aware that a "broken" map file could
potentially crash the application when loaded and we've fixed that problem now
too.

You can read about the other changes in our change log:

The next maintenance release will be 6.4.6, to be released on demand.
The next major release will be 6.5, around the end of the year... maybe...
