Hi everyone,

today we've released the third preview version of XCSoar 6.2.
This version includes several smaller bugfixes including one
miscalculation of airspace distances. The circling wind calculator that
was broken in 6.2_alpha2 is working again. In addition to that John have
developed a new wind algorithm that replaces the ZigZag mode. It should
bring almost instant wind measurements if a device is connected that
sends airspeed information to XCSoar.

Change log:

The 6.1 series will be discontinued after the final release 6.2.
