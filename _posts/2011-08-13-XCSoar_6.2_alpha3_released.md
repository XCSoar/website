Hi everyone,

today we've released the third preview version of XCSoar 6.2.
This version includes several smaller bugfixes including one 
miscalculation of airspace distances. The circling wind calculator that 
was broken in 6.2_alpha2 is working again. In addition to that John have 
developed a new wind algorithm that replaces the ZigZag mode. It should 
bring almost instant wind measurements if a device is connected that 
sends airspeed information to XCSoar.

Change log:
