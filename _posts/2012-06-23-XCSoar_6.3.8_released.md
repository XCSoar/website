Sorry to bother you again, but it seems that our last release had a small
problem. On some of the Windows based platforms the bitmaps weren't drawn
properly due to an updated tool in our build process that included an
undocumented change of behaviour. We have made sure that this problem will not
bother us again in the future and have uploaded this new release for all
affected users.

Changelog:

The next maintenance release will be 6.3.9, to be released on demand.
The next major release will be 6.4, scheduled for next month.
