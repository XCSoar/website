Merry christmas and a happy new year!

This is the first new release of XCSoar this year and it fixes a few minor bugs
in all different places:

* Several device drivers were updated, including Leonardo, C-Probe and the
Glidertools Altimeter
* On some WinCE devices the serial port caused a lockup when the application was
closed, which should be fixed now. (Thanks for that to our new developer Stefan
Lofgren)
* The airspace file parser has received a bit of our time to make it more
robust. It is now even able to handle the complicated airspace structure around
Syracuse in the United States.

There were a few more fixes and you can read about the rest in our change log:
