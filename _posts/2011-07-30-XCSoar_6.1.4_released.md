title: XCSoar 6.1.4 released!
---
Hi everyone,

the fourth maintenance release of XCSoar 6.1 might be the last one
before the 6.2 release, we hope.

Again, it reduces the memory usage, for smoother operation on PPC2000.
The biggest change is an optimisation of the airspace renderer, which
now runs twice as fast (on Windows).  Altair users won't see the
screen upside down anymore.

Change log:

The next major release will be 6.2, going beta soon.
The 6.1 series will be discontinued after the final release 6.2.
