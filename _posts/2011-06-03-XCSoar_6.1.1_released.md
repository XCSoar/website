title: XCSoar 6.1.1 released!
---
Today we have released the first maintenance release of XCSoar 6.1.  
It contains numerous fixes, most of them for the Altair and old PDAs (PPC2000).

Increased memory usage was responsible for crashes on both Altair and
PPC2000.  These devices have very small main memory, and new 6.1
features were too expensive for them.  With some careful profiling, we
could reduce the memory usage by several megabytes.  We will optimise
further in 6.1.2.

The next major release will be 6.2.
