Hi everyone (and our nordic friends in particular),

we have just updated our MapGenerator and from now on you should be able to
create maps for Iceland including terrain!

Unfortunatly I noticed that our waypoint database for Iceland is essentially
empty. We are using the Welt2000 database for waypoint information. If you
have up-to-date waypoint files and want to share them with the world please
contact the [welt2000](mailto:welt2000@gmx.net) guys and tell them.
