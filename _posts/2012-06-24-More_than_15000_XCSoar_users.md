According to Google Play, there are now 15,023 XCSoar users on Android!

The first 10k users took about a year, and it took only 4 months to add 50% more
(my old announcement).

Note that Google Play counts only people using Android, without duplicates (if
you have more than one Android phone/tablet), and of course excluding those who
have a Windows CE/Mobile device. We have no idea how many users run XCSoar on
Windows CE/Mobile.
