Hi everyone,

the XCSoar developers are proud to announce the release 6.2!

Some highlights:

- flight download from CAI302 and IMI ERIXX
- Android IOIO driver
- new fast and accurate wind algorithm (requires airspeed)
- better airspace warnings (horizontal and vertical distance)
- better profile support
- many optimisations, for increased battery runtime
- ... and many more

Apologies for the outdated user manual.  Updating it for the new 6.2
features is one of our next goals.
