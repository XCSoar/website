The second beta of XCSoar 6.6 brings major improvements to the
circling wind algorithm.  The algorithm is now faster and more
reliable.  Support for non-metric units has been improved, and a few
old bugs were fixed.

The final release has been delayed by a few more days, and will be
ready for the Aero 2013 in Friedrichshafen next week.  Visit our booth
at A1-124!
