Hi everyone!

About half a year ago we released XCSoar 6.4 and now it is time for the next
chapter: **XCSoar 6.5**. This is not the real deal yet, but with this release we
would like to give you a preview of the things that are coming in the near
future. Please test this version carefully and let us know if you find any bugs
or have other things you want to tell us about!

Here is a short overview of what has changed compared to XCSoar 6.4:

* basic support for drawing FAI triangle areas
* high-resolution terrain rendering for Android devices
* possibility to show a task start countdown
* optimized racing tasks (minimum distance)
* support for built-in pressure sensors on the IOIO board (BMP085 and MS5611)
* the FLARM radar is no longer hiding the infoboxes and only replaces the map
* better default fonts for the lists and infoboxes
* thermal assistant infobox

and maybe most important:

* a [German]({{ site.download_server_url }}/6.5_alpha1/XCSoar-manual-de.pdf) an
a [French]({{ site.download_server_url }}/6.5_alpha1/XCSoar-manual-fr.pdf)
