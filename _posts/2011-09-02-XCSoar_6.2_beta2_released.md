Hi everyone,

in the last days we have eliminated a good number of bugs that we (and you!)
have found in the last beta and alpha versions of XCSoar 6.2. Just to give
examples: AAT time calculation is working again, clipping problems and crashes
in the task editor and target dialog have been fixed and so on...

This is the second beta version, and unless we find more serious bugs in the
next days we should release the final version of XCSoar 6.2 very soon.

Preliminary change log:

 <{{ site.download_server_url }}/6.2_beta2/NEWS.txt>

The final version 6.2 will be released soon.  Please help:

- report bugs: <{{site.trac_server_url}}/newticket>
- translate the user interface: <https://translations.launchpad.net/xcsoar/trunk>

The current "stable" release is still 6.1.5, and the 6.1 series will
be discontinued after the 6.2 release.
