Hi,

we are nearly finished with the development of XCSoar 6.2.  Since
version 6.1, three months have passed, and 30 people have contributed
more than 2,200 changes.

This is the first beta version, and we will concentrate on bug fixing
now.

Preliminary change log:

The final version 6.2 will be released soon.  Please help:

- report bugs: <{{site.trac_server_url}}/newticket>
- translate the user interface: <https://translations.launchpad.net/xcsoar/trunk>

The current "stable" release is still 6.1.5, and the 6.1 series will
be discontinued after the 6.2 release.
