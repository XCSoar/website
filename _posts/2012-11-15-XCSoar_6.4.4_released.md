Hi everyone!

A few bugs have been fixed in the last two weeks and we felt that it was time
for another maintenance release. Feel free to update your devices to XCSoar
6.4.4 if these fixes are important to you.

Some Android devices had problems with the font rendering, and after one of our
users was kind enough to send his devices over for testing we could finally fix
this problem. We hope that fixing it on his device (Archos 101) will also
improve the situation on other devices with a similar graphics chip.

For quite some time now our wind-related infobox panels were missing the button
to change the infobox contents. We are sorry that we didn't fix it earlier but
now you can use that panel like any other too.

The Altair users will be happy to hear that we fixed the behavior of the Escape
key, after breaking it in a previous release without noticing it.

You can read about the other bugfixes in our change log:

The next maintenance release will be 6.4.5, to be released on demand.
The next major release will be 6.5, around the end of the year.
