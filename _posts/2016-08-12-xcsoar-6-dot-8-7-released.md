The seventh maintenance release of XCSoar 6.8 fixes two potential
crash bugs and one minor SkyLines live tracking bugs.

Most importantly, this release prepares a new revolutionary feature,
which we will introduce later: the
[XCSoar Cloud](http://cloud.xcsoar.net/).
It is a service
which allows sharing thermal/wave locations and other weather data
with pilots in your area.  This release adds some basic code, which
allows us to develop and test the service; please enable it to help
development.  The full feature set will be available in XCSoar 7.0.
