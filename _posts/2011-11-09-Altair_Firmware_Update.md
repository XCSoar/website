Good news for Altair users:
Triadis have released their 07 Altair Firmware

<http://triadis.triadis.biz/downloads/altair/update/>

This allows you to run XCSoar.exe from the root of a USB Stick - making it
easier to run XCSoar 6.x and try new versions.

Download XCSoarAltair.zip, uncompress and move/rename the file from
ToAltair/XCSoarAltair-600-CRC3E.exe to the top of your USB disk as XCSoar.exe.
Create an XCSoarData directory on your USB key and you're pretty much done.
