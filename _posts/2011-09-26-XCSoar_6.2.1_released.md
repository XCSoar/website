Hi everyone,

today we have released the first maintenance release of XCSoar 6.2. It fixes a
few minor bugs and a bigger one on the Altair platform which made 6.2 unusable.
All Altair owners with 6.2 should update to 6.2.1 to enable the rotary button
again.

The other changes include update speed improvements for the METAR/TAF
download feature and some bugfixes in particular for the Android platform.

Besides that we have focused on updating the manual for the 6.2 series. There
is still a lot of work to do though and if you would like to contribute then
please let us know. The less time the developers need to spend on updating the
manual, the more time they can spend on improving the application ifself.

Change log:

The next maintenance release will be 6.2.2, to be released on demand.
The next major release will be 6.3.
