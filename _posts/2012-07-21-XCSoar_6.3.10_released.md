Hi,

Due to a task calculation bug, it was necessary to publish another
maintenance release of XCSoar 6.3.  Up to 6.3.9, the orientation of
observation zones could be slightly wrong.  Not much, but enough for a
pilot to miss the finish line by a hundred metres.

Changelog:

  <{{ site.download_server_url }}/6.3.10/NEWS.txt>

At the same time, we publish the first beta version of XCSoar 6.4.
Development of this new version will be finished very soon, hopefully
before the end of the month.
