Hi everyone,

over the weekend we've finished the third bugfix release of XCSoar 6.2.
We fixed many of your bug reports and also fixed a few bugs that we had found
along the way. Most importantly though: This is the first release that includes
a version for Mac OSX! Some things might not work yet as good as on other
platforms, but if you tells us whats wrong we will try to fix it for the next
versions.
