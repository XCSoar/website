During a short development cycle lasting only two weeks, XCSoar 6.6
has gained a lot of new features, many of which have been requested a
long time ago on our [bug
tracker]({{site.trac_server_url}}/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&milestone=!%23+Map+Generator&milestone=!%23+SkyLines&milestone=!%23+Website&milestone=!XCSoar+Manual&max=1000&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=time&col=changetime&col=reporter&desc=1&order=changetime).
It will be ready in about two weeks.  Meanwhile, you may test the
first alpha version.

* MAT tasks, AAT keyhole, sector with custom radius
* distinct map zoom on each page
