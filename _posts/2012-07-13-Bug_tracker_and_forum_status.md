Hi,

as many of you may have noticed, our bug tracker and the forum are
both still down.  The server that has been hosting both has been
riddled by hardware failures many times in the past months, and proved
to be very unreliable.

This strikes us at a very inconvenient time, when XCSoar 6.4 beta
testing is about to begin.

We have decided to get a new server at a more reliable hosting
provider, and it is operational since yesterday.  Problem is the
backup I got is 2 weeks old, and I'm waiting for a recent backup (I
hope there is one!).  I hope this will be repaired completely until
tomorrow.
