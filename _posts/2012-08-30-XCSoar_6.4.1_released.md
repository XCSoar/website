Hi everyone!

One month after we've given you XCSoar 6.4, we've just release the first
maintenance version for the 6.4 branch. I've used 6.4 myself on two competitions
last month and I was very happy with it. There were however a few minor things
that were bugging me, so we've fixed them:

* "Final GR" infobox is fixed
* Flarm Team Colors are properly saved in the profile
* Flarm targets are shown properly in the Map Item List
* A few device drivers have been fixed
* Bluetooth support for Windows CE is fixed/improved
* Airspace arc resolution is improved (more on that later!)

You can read about the rest of the fixes in our change log:

The next maintenance release will be 6.4.2, to be released on demand.
The next major release will be 6.5, around the end of the year.
