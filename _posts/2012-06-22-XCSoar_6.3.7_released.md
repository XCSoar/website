Hi everyone!

Here comes yet another maintenance release for XCSoar 6.3. There are no major
changes this time, but a few minor ones. Due to some hardware donations by
LX Nav we were able to improve the support for the LX V7 vario and Nano logger.

The automatic crash detection works really nice now and we would like to thank
all of our users that reported any crashes. Due to these submissions a crash in
the METAR download code could be fixed in XCSoar 6.3.7. Users of the OLC League
scoring were experiencing situations where the timeframe of the scoring exeeded
the 2.5 hours, this is fixed too now.

XCSoar 6.4 is on its way and you can expect the start of the alpha testing phase
in the next weeks. Android users can already have a look by using the [testing
version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.xcsoar.testing) from
the Google Play Store.
