Hi everyone!

Here comes one last maintenance release of the XCSoar 6.3 branch before we enter
the beta-testing phase of the upcoming XCSoar 6.4. A small number of bugs were
fixed in this release including one potential crash, when using custom "status
files". The airspeed parsing of the VW921 is fixed too, which was reading the
values with the wrong units, due to a bug in the official documentation.

Unfortunately our old server has died completely in the meantime and the last
backup was a few days old. If you feel that any tickets or comments are missing
from the bug tracker please try to reproduce them. Our forum is still offline,
but we are working on reviving it in the near future.
