Hi everyone,

here comes another maintenance release for XCSoar 6.2. Once again we have
fixed several bugs in this release. On some Windows Mobile PDAs the
start bar was not disappearing correctly when installed from a CAB file. This
problem should be fixed now. If you still experience this (or another) problem
please [tell us](/develop/new_ticket.html)!

Also we fixed the handling of negative UTC timezone offsets. In case your
flying in one of the Americas please check that the offset setting is still
correct.

You can read about all other bugfixes in our changelog:

The next major release will be 6.3, to be released around February.
