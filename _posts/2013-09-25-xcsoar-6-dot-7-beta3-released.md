The third beta of the upcoming XCSoar version 6.7 fixes more bugs,
all of which were reported long ago:

* render finish point as achieved when task is finished
* subtract start/finish cylinder radius from task distance
* enable circling wind calculation in IGC replay
* fix name truncation when saving a waypoint file on Windows

These bugs were complicated enough that I postponed fixing them again
and again (thanks for being patient).  Please test this new beta on
the next weekend, and report bugs.

The final 6.7 release will be ready on September 30th.
