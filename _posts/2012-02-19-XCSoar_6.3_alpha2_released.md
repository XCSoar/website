Hi everyone!

Here comes the second preview version of [XCSoar 6.3](/download/latest.html).
There have been a few rendering problems on Android and other problems on
other platforms too, but we have fixed most of them.

In addition to that we have improved support for the LX devices lately
with the LX MiniMap in particular. The additional hardware buttons should
work as planned now.

Remember that this is still a potentially unstable alpha version. Test it as
much as possible, but don't rely on it completely yet. You should always have
a stable backup version available.
