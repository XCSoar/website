Hi everyone!

Three weeks ago we released the first stable version of XCSoar 6.3 and today
we uploaded the first maintenance release that fixes quite a few bugs. This
is also the first release with a dedicated version for 64 bit Windows computers.

Good news for users of the IOIO board: XCSoar will no longer freeze if you
quit and don't have the board connected. Good news also for users of older
PDAs: No more unintentional double key presses. Under the hood we also fixed
a few smaller bugs that lead to crashes, wrong calculations or problems with
connected devices.

You can see the list of bugs that were fixed in the changelog:

The next maintenance release will be 6.3.2, to be released on demand.
The next major release will be 6.4, scheduled in about three to four month.
