Hi everyone,

the second bugfix release of XCSoar 6.2 is ready for delivery! We have fixed
a number of minor and some major bugs. Just to name a few: automatic QNH
calculation was slighlty off in the past, Reach/Route calculation returned wrong
numbers on strong wind conditions, instant L/D showed bad values, ...

Also we have fixed a problem in our IGC file writer that enables you to use
the [MaxPunkte](http://www.maxpunkte.de/) application to analyze your IGC
files.

You can read the whole list of bugs that were fixed in the change log:
