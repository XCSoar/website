Hi everyone!

There it is: XCSoar 6.3, the final version. 

Compared to the last beta3 release we have fixed two major bugs that prevented
the K6BT option and the Flarm driver from working properly and also a few
other minor bugs.

Just to give you a quick overview of what this version holds for you when you've
used XCSoar 6.2 before:

* faster OLC calculations
* a serial port monitor
* proper finish cylinder optimizations
* Flarm IGC file downloads
* Westerboer VW921 and FlyNet vario support
* new “MapItem” list when clicking on the map
* two-finger panning on Android
* improved METAR parsing
* kinetic scrolling on some platforms
* UTM coordinate format
* experimental DPI-aware dialogs
* fullscreen mode for Linux
* LiveTrack24 tracking
* baro. sensor support on Android devices. 
* start-only mode for the internal IGC logger (for paragliders)
