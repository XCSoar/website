Hi again!

Seems we are on a run today... This is the third alpha version of XCSoar 6.3.
We are getting closer to the beta phase with every day and the stable version
should be here by the start of the season. Please test this version as much as
you can to identify any remaining problems.

This release has a few new features for you. Users of the K6BT module will
love to hear that XCSoar is now able to switch the baudrate of the module
directly. We have also improved the LX and Volkslogger device drivers.
Previously the transfer connection to LX devices was timing out when in the
flight list dialog. This problem should be fixed now. Our flight download code
is still not quite as perfect as we wish it would be, but we are working on
improving that!

If you notice that XCSoar doesn't have support for your device yet
(Zander ZS1 for example) please contact the manufacturer and ask them to
cooperate with us by sending us the necessary documentation to implement these
features.
