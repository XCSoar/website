Hi everyone!

Quite a lot of time has passed again since the last maintenance release of
XCSoar was published and only a few new bugs have been reported since then.
This makes us very confident that our efforts to make XCSoar 6.4 a very stable
application are paying off.

Here are the most important changes in this version:

* Blanik L13-AC, Ka 6E and AK-8 polars
* LXNav and Volkslogger communication over IOIO is fixed
* CAI302/Borgelt B800 ballast setting is fixed
* various small fixes for the file manager
* fixed crash when using checklist files with a special format

You can read about the rest of the fixes in our change log:

The next maintenance release will be 6.4.3, to be released on demand.
The next major release will be 6.5, around the end of the year.
