Hi everyone!

Just before the month of August starts we finally release XCSoar 6.4. In case
you haven't read it in any previous news posts yet, here is a summary of all
the new things that made it into this release:

* FLARM setup dialog
* new GliderTools Altimeter and Compass C-Probe driver
* improved LXNav V7 and Nano support and new setup dialog
* configurable airspace rendering
* "Airspace On/Off" button in the menu
* METAR stations shown on the map
* "dots for sink" trail styles (similar to Condor)
* FLARM teammates are saved in the profile
* configurable map item list + GoTo button
* show screen gestures while drawing them
* first iteration of a file download manager
* automatic altitude and wind arrow infoboxes
* support for the FFVV NetCoupe contest

and most important for our Android users that have devices with built-in
barometric sensors:

* audio vario output (only Android 2.3 and above)

We are pretty confident, that this release is as stable as the old XCSoar
6.3.11, but if you find any error please report them and help us fix them as
quickly as you can.
