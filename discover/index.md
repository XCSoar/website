XCSoar is a tactical glide computer originally developed for the Pocket PC
platform. In 2005, the originally commercial software was given to the
open-source community for further development and has constantly been
improved since. It is now a multi-platform application that currently
runs on Windows, Windows Mobile, Unix and even Android devices.

Today XCSoar has almost everything you would need as a glider pilot... and more!
