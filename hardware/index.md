XCSoar runs on a wide variety of hardware: all desktop computers
(Windows, Linux, Mac OS X), Android (smartphones, tablets, car GPS), and embedded Linux.
Support to Windows CE (PDAs, PNAs, ...) is discontinued (but still maintained in XCSoar 6.8.x). 

XCSoar is compatible with many peripheral hardware such as varios and
loggers. Consult [the manual](/discover/manual.html) for an extensive
list.

Many users ask us what hardware they shall buy for running XCSoar.
This section describes setups that have been verified to work well.
Please note that screen readabillity in direct sunlight is a key feature when choosing a device.

# Android

XCsoar has been reported to work on many android products, whether they are smartphones, tablets or car GPS.
Note that XCsoar requires Android 1.6 or up.

## Built-in GPS
Most Android devices have built-in GPS. It is good enough for many pilots,
but there are reasons to connect to other devices: better accuracy,
MacCready synchronization, task declaration, IGC file download...

## Bluetooth or IOIO?
Android devices don't have a serial port. There are two ways to
connect peripherals:

- *Bluetooth*: the wireless solution; you can connect up to 7
  Bluetooth adapters to your Android
- *IOIO*: the wired solution; one IOIO adapter has up to 4 serial
  ports and charges your Android at the same time

Examples for Bluetooth adapters:

- [SoarTronic's bluetooth adapter](http://www.soartronic.net/products) BT1 (only compatible with FLARM) and BT2
- [K6-Team K6 BT Mux 2](https://www.k6-team.de/K6-Bt-Mux-2-NMEA-Multiplexer-mit-Bluetooth), a solution that allows baud rate switching
- you can build your own

Examples for IOIO adapters:

- [SoarTronic](http://www.soartronic.net/products) has a Do-It-Yourself kit
  (without the actual IOIO board)
- you can [build your own](https://github.com/ytai/ioio/wiki)

# Kobo

XCSoar supports multiple Kobo e-book readers. These device have an e-ink screen.
It is black and white, but is perfectly readable in direct sunlight.

The following Kobo models are supported:

- Kobo Mini
- Kobo Glo
- Kobo Touch 2.0
- Kobo Glo HD
- Kobo Aura Edition 2

[More information about XCSoar on the Kobo Mini](http://max.kellermann.name/projects/xcsoar/kobo.html).

# Windows CE

XCSoar on Windows CE is discontinued. While it is still supported in XCSoar 6.8.x,  future XCSoar releases will not support this operating system any more.

# Peripherals

## Borgelt B800
The [Borgelt B800](http://www.borgeltinstruments.com/?page_id=48) is fully supported by XCSoar.
The [Borgelt Bluetooth Blade](http://www.borgeltinstruments.com/?page_id=156) is the dedicated bluetooth adapter.

## Cambridge CAI302
The CAI302 is fully supported by XCSoar, thanks to Cambridge's
complete protocol documentation. To allow fast IGC file download, it
is recommended to use the [K6-Team Bluetooth adapter](https://www.k6-team.de/K6-Bt-Mux-2-NMEA-Multiplexer-mit-Bluetooth).

## EW microRecorder
The EW microRecorder is fully supported by XCSoar.

## FLARM
Connecting to a FLARM gives you barometric height and information
about nearby traffic (FLARM radar). XCSoar can send task declarations
to an IGC FLARM and can read valid IGC files from it.

[SoarTronic's bluetooth adapter](http://www.soartronic.net/products) is a
cheap way to connect a FLARM.

## IMI ERIXX
The [IMI ERIXX](http://www.imi-gliding.com/products/erixx-flight-recorder.html) is fully supported by XCSoar.

## LXNAV S7/S8/S100/Nano
LXNAV [S7](https://www.lxnav.nl/v7.html), [S8](https://www.lxnav.nl/s8.html),
[S100](https://www.lxnav.nl/s100.html) and [Nano](http://www.lxnav.com/products/nano.html) are fully
supported by XCSoar, thanks to LXNAV's hardware donations.

LXNAV S8, S100 and Nano have built-in Bluetooth.
LXNAV sells [a Bluetooth adapter for the S7](https://gliding.lxnav.com/products/s7-s8-s80-bluetooth-module/).

## OpenVario
XCSoar is at the heart of the [OpenVario flight computer](https://www.openvario.org/doku.php).
While OpenVario can be home-built, it can also be assembled for you by a [builder](https://www.openvario.org/doku.php?id=builders:top).

## RBE Avionik GliderNav-O1
The [RBE Avionik GliderNav-O1](https://rbe-avionik.de/index.php/produkte/biofeet-erfahrungen) natively runs XCSoar.
